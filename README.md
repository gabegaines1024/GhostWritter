# GhostWritter
GhostWriter is a professional-grade, real-time collaborative editor designed specifically for screenwriters. Unlike generic document editors, GhostWriter understands the semantics of screenplay formatting (INT/EXT, Dialogue, Parentheticals) and provides a low-latency environment for creative teams to build stories together.
